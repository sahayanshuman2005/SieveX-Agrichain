📖 Overview
AgriChain is a simplified yet powerful blockchain platform that brings transparency to agricultural supply chains. Built on Ethereum, it provides immutable tracking of products from farm to consumer while maintaining ease of use and cost-effectiveness.
🎯 Problem Statement

Lack of transparency in food supply chains
Consumer trust issues with product authenticity
Difficulty tracking contamination sources
Complex systems that are hard to implement
High costs of IoT-based solutions

✨ Our Solution
AgriChain provides a blockchain-based platform that:

✅ Records every step of the supply chain immutably
✅ Enables QR code tracking for instant product history
✅ Supports multiple stakeholders with role-based access
✅ Requires no hardware - purely software-based
✅ Scales gradually - start simple, add features later
